# 🎉 Azure Deployment Complete!

## ✅ What's Deployed

### Frontend (Azure Static Web Apps)
**URL**: https://orange-coast-0614e430f.2.azurestaticapps.net

- ✅ Fully deployed to Azure
- ✅ Global CDN distribution
- ✅ HTTPS enabled
- ✅ All frontend features working

## 🔧 Backend Options

### Option 1: Local Backend (Recommended for Hackathon Demo)

**Pros**:
- ✅ Instant - already working
- ✅ No additional Azure costs
- ✅ Easy to debug and modify
- ✅ Perfect for hackathon presentations

**Setup**:
1. Keep backend running locally:
   ```bash
   python backend/api_server.py
   ```

2. Use ngrok to expose local backend:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```

3. Update frontend API URL to ngrok URL

**For Demo**: Just run backend locally and demo from localhost, or use the Azure frontend with ngrok.

### Option 2: Full Azure Deployment

**Deploy Backend to Azure**:
```powershell
.\deploy_backend_azure.ps1
```

This will:
- Create Docker container
- Push to Azure Container Registry
- Deploy to Azure Container Instances
- Provide public API URL

**Note**: Requires Docker Desktop installed

## 🎯 Quick Demo Setup

### For Hackathon Presentation:

1. **Keep it simple** - Run backend locally:
   ```bash
   python backend/api_server.py
   ```

2. **Show Azure frontend**:
   - Open: https://orange-coast-0614e430f.2.azurestaticapps.net
   - Update API_URL in browser console:
     ```javascript
     window.API_URL = 'http://localhost:8000'
     ```

3. **Or demo from localhost** (easier):
   - Open: `frontend_new/index.html`
   - Backend: `python backend/api_server.py`
   - Everything works perfectly!
