## Quick Setup

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended)

```powershell
.\setup_chatbot.ps1
```

This script will:
1. Create Azure OpenAI resource
2. Deploy GPT-4 model
3. Configure your backend
4. Update Azure Container App (optional)

**Time**: ~5 minutes  
**Cost**: ~$30-50/month for light usage

### Option 2: Manual Setup

See `CHATBOT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

### Option 3: Use Without AI (Mock Mode)

The chatbot UI works without Azure OpenAI! It will use mock data for events.

Just run:
```powershell
python backend/api_server.py
```

## How It Works

- Cache common responses

## Integration with Real Events

The chatbot currently uses mock event data. To integrate real events:

### Ticketmaster API
```python
# Sign up: https://developer.ticketmaster.com/
TICKETMASTER_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Eventbrite API
```python
# Sign up: https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api
EVENTBRITE_API_KEY=your-key
```

### Google Places API
```python
# Sign up: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your-key
```

See `CHATBOT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for integration code.
